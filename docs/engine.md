Design a comprehensive development system that maximizes automation for formalizing a large theorem in Lean 4 (similar to massot's sphere eversion project), leveraging Claude Code, GitHub integration, lean-specific models, and local compute resources.
Available resources:

Claude Code with ability to spawn subagents for parallel tasks
Top-tier 2025 MacBook (assume M4 Max/Ultra with 128GB+ RAM)
Access to lean-specific models (LeanDojo, Lean Copilot, ReProver, etc.)
GitHub for version control and CI/CD
Blueprint infrastructure for proof management

Goals to optimize for:

Continuous background verification/proof search using ~50% of local compute
Automatic lemma extraction and dependency resolution
Parallel exploration of proof branches
Smart work distribution between Claude Code, local models, and cloud resources

Specific areas to address:

Local inference pipeline: How to run LeanDojo/ReProver continuously in background, prioritizing stuck goals
Claude Code orchestration: Optimal subagent patterns (proof writer, verifier, refactorer, blueprint updater)
Hybrid search strategy: When to use Claude's reasoning vs local tactic search vs brute force enumeration
Git workflow automation: Auto-branching for experimental proofs, PR generation for completed lemmas
Progress monitoring: Dashboard or system to track formalization coverage, bottlenecks, compute utilization
Cache management: Sharing successful tactics/patterns between local and cloud models
Failure recovery: Automatic backtracking and alternative approach generation when proofs fail

Constraints:

Keep local CPU/GPU at ~50% to maintain laptop usability
Minimize redundant work between different proof search methods
Ensure all automation is interruptible and checkpoint-able

Provide concrete implementation strategies, tool configurations, and example workflows."
Additional angles you might want to explore:
For the local compute aspect specifically:

"Design a proof search scheduler that dynamically allocates compute based on goal difficulty estimates"
"How to use local LLMs for 'proof sketch validation' before expensive formal verification"
"Implement speculative execution for multiple proof strategies in parallel"

For Claude Code coordination:

"Create a 'proof clinic' pattern where subagents review each other's work"
"Design a lemma marketplace where subagents can request/provide helper lemmas"
"Implement 'proof golf' competitions between subagents to minimize proof length"

For the GitHub integration:

"Auto-generate blueprint documentation from successful proofs"
"Create GitHub Actions that trigger heavier cloud compute for critical paths"
"Design PR templates that include formal verification status, compute cost, and complexity metrics"

Below is a production‑grade blueprint for a heavily automated Lean 4 formalization system on a 2025 MacBook (M4 Max/Ultra, 128 GB+ RAM), coordinated by Claude Code sub‑agents, backed by LeanDojo/Lean Copilot/ReProver, with GitHub CI and blueprint docs. I’ve included concrete commands, configs, and example workflows.

Core data flows

LeanDojo trace + Dojo interaction gives goal states and executes external tactics programmatically. (Lean 4 supported; caching in ~/.cache/lean_dojo.) 
GitHub
LeanDojo

Lean Copilot provides in‑Lean tactics (suggest_tactics, search_proof, select_premises) and native inference via CTranslate2; can run local or external models. 
GitHub

ReProver (retrieval‑augmented) supplies retriever + generator (HuggingFace ByT5 checkpoints) and evaluation scripts; supports Lean 4. 
GitHub

Blueprint (leanblueprint) builds an interactive dependency graph + docs and can be auto‑generated/updated. 
GitHub

Lean CI: lean-action runs Lake build / test / lint with caching; mathlib cache via lake exe cache get.

1) Local setup — Lean, mathlib cache, Copilot, Dojo, ReProver
Lean + Lake + toolchain (macOS)
# toolchain manager
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
# verify
elan show
(Elan selects lean/lake per repo’s lean-toolchain.) 
GitHub

Project skeleton (Lake + mathlib + Copilot)
lean/lakefile.lean

import Lake
open Lake DSL

package «ProjectBigTheorem» where
  -- Needed by Lean Copilot native generator (CTranslate2)
  moreLinkArgs := #[
    "-L./.lake/packages/LeanCopilot/.lake/build/lib",

Enable LeanDojo locally
# Python 3.11+ recommended
pipx install "lean-dojo"
# or: pip install lean-dojo
LeanDojo docs: Lean 4 compatible (≥ v4.3.0‑rc2), caches in ~/.cache/lean_dojo, env knobs like NUM_PROCS. 
GitHub
LeanDojo

ReProver models (local, ARM ok with CPU; GPU optional)
# isolated env for reprover workers
conda create -y -n reprover python=3.11
conda activate reprover
pip install torch transformers vllm tqdm loguru "pytorch-lightning[extra]" lean-dojo
# retrieve/convert or pull HF checkpoints directly in scripts
Use its retriever/generator & evaluation scripts (index corpus → evaluate / generate tactics). 
GitHub

2) Local inference pipeline (continuous background)
Goal: keep ~50% local CPU/GPU busy doing targeted proof search on the current “stuck” surface.

Background services
orchestrator/workers/dojo_runner.py

Subscribes to goal queue; uses LeanDojo to open a Dojo at a “repl” placeholder and stream tactics; updates checkpoints and returns new goal states. (LeanDojo “Interact with Lean” via dojo.py.) 
LeanDojo

orchestrator/workers/copilot_runner.lean

In‑Lean tactics like search_proof & select_premises with tunable Aesop options (beam size/depth). Copilot supports restricting to certain prefixes (simp, rw, …). 
GitHub
+1

orchestrator/workers/reprover_runner.py

Maintains a premise index (ByT5 encoder); periodically refreshes embeddings of local library deltas; uses retrieval‑augmented generator for tactic proposals; records success stats. 
GitHub

orchestrator/scheduler/ (detailed in §4)

Difficulty‑aware queue + budgeted parallelism. Limits host utilization to ~50% via token bucket on concurrency, not CPU throttling (more stable on macOS).

Adjustable “fast vs thorough” allocation (Aesop/simp/rewrite micro‑bursts vs deeper LLM/prover searches).

orchestrator/cache/

State cache: normalized goal text → (top tactics, success probabilities, average time).

Premise cache: state embedding → top‑k premises.

Tactic shard cache: tactic templates with holes + instantiation stats.

Backed by SQLite + FAISS (or ScaNN). Shareable artifacts (see §8).

File watchers (watchexec):

On src/**/*.lean changes, publish invalidated goals; cancel stale runs; rebuild minimal set with lake build to sync kernel.

Lean integration notes

Aesop is the default white‑box search tactic; Copilot’s search_proof wraps Aesop with LLM suggestions; use its options interface to tune breadth/limits. 
GitHub
People at DTU Compute

Lean’s LSP / RPC is JSON‑RPC under the hood; if you need custom RPCs (e.g., remote references), consult Lean.Server.Rpc.* (but LeanDojo + Dojo is usually simpler). 
Lean Community
DROPS

3) Claude Code orchestration (sub‑agent patterns)
Roles (spawned as subagents with clear SLAs and bounded budgets):

Proof‑Writer

Reads a current goal + context; writes a sketch (human‑style plan) and a minimal Lean skeleton with by blocks and TODO stubs; requests helper lemmas via Lemma Requests (see marketplace).

Verifier

Uses Dojo to try Proof‑Writer’s script tactic‑by‑tactic; inlines quick fixes; if blocked ≥N seconds, opens Lemma Requests for missing facts.

Refactorer / Golfers (N agents)

Compete to shorten successful proofs (metric: #tactics, compile time). Winner PR merges; losers’ attempts saved for training cache.

Blueprint Updater

Keeps \lean{...} / \leanok markers in blueprint/src/content.tex aligned with repo status; updates dependency graph sections; opens doc PRs. (leanblueprint produces both HTML and PDF, with doc‑gen API links.) 
GitHub

Search Coordinator

Talks to the scheduler; splits a goal across strategies: (A) Copilot search, (B) ReProver RAG tactics, (C) “brute micro‑enums” (rewrite/simp variants), (D) human‑sketch validation (local LLM); monitors duplication via cache signatures.

Coordination patterns

Proof Clinic: Proof‑Writer drafts → Verifier runs; if fail, clinic asks ReProver to propose a local rewrite/premise list; Copilot tries short search; fallback to “sketch‑then‑prove” loop.

Lemma marketplace:

Subagents publish tickets:

{
  "ticket_id": "lem-2025-08-23-1234",
  "type": "lemma_request",
  "goal": "∀ ε>0, ...",
  "context": ["Hausdorff", "smooth_map ..."],
  "suggested_name": "foo.bar_baz",
  "constraints": ["noncomputable", "[simp] desirable"],
  "priority": 0.82
}
Marketplace routes to a helper‑lemma queue; suppliers (Copilot/ReProver/Writer) compete; ticket resolved → dependency edge recorded for reuse.

Proof golf: Run N short‑budget agents (e.g., Copilot with different seeds/beam) to minimize length/latency; store best‑of‑N.

4) Proof‑search scheduler (compute‑aware, difficulty‑aware)
Invariants: keep host usable; minimize redundant work; interruptible + checkpointable.

Difficulty model (per goal g)
Features:

structural: size(target AST), #locals, #metavars, #simp-rewrites available;

blueprint depth/centrality; #unresolved prerequisites;

learned: Copilot/ReProver predicted success‐prob or min tactic length.

Define a goal score:

difficulty(g) = σ( w·features(g) )
priority(g)   = w1 * criticality(g) + w2 * (1 - difficulty(g)) + w3 * blueprint_impact(g)
Then allocate budgets (tokens, time, parallel slots) by UCB‑style multi‑armed bandit over strategies S = {Copilot, ReProver, micro‑enums, human‑sketch‑validation}, with observed rewards = success/step, proof shortened, new lemma learned, etc.

Throttling to ~50% host
Concurrency control (preferred on macOS): cap total worker coroutines per class. Maintain moving average of CPU% (e.g., psutil.getloadavg() & time.perf_counter() callbacks). If 5‑min EMA > 50%, reduce heavy slots first (ReProver generation, Copilot deep search); keep light slots (rewrite/simp).

GPU budget: limit concurrent generator jobs; for local CTranslate2 (Copilot native), cap batch size/beam. (Copilot supports configuring generator/encoder via its Model APIs.) 
GitHub

Speculative execution
For each goal, fan out 3–6 short strategies (e.g., aesop limited depth; simp? enumerations; 2 tiny Copilot runs) with a 5–15s cutoff; the first success cancels others (cooperative cancellation). If none succeeds, escalate to a deep strategy (ReProver RAG + Copilot large beam) with a strict wallclock budget.

Checkpointing
Every tactic execution (Dojo or in‑Lean) is a checkpoint record: (goal_hash, strategy, tactic, outcome, time, premises_used). On interruption, resume from last proven subgoal frontier.

5) Hybrid search policy (when to use what)
Cheap rewrites/simplifications (micro‑enums): if target contains aligned patterns (simp, rw, ring, linarith cases), run first; very high throughput.

Copilot select_premises + search_proof: the default mid‑tier; quick premises then Aesop‑guided search. (Configs live in Lean; good for breadth‑first shallow trees.) 
GitHub

ReProver: when difficulty estimate ≥ θ or Copilot plateaus; it excels if premises matter (retrieval + ByT5 generator). Maintain a hot index of current corpus; incremental reindex on new lemmas. 
GitHub

Claude (reasoning LLM): for proof‑sketch validation ahead of expensive runs. Claude checks term types, outlines steps, suggests lemma names; if sketch consistent (no glaring coercion/typeclass holes), authorize deep search; else bounce back to marketplace to ask for missing helper lemmas.

6) GitHub workflow automation
Branching & PR automation
Auto‑branch per successful lemma: auto/lem/<namespace>/<lemma> with commit message:

feat(lean): add <namespace>.<lemma>
[status] fully_proved=true
[metrics] time=12.4s tactics=5 strategies=Copilot+aesop
[cost] local_cpu_s=30 local_gpu_s=0 cloud_gpu_s=0

Blueprint + API docs to Pages — .github/workflows/docs.yml

lake build + doc-gen4 for API; leanblueprint web for blueprint; publish to gh-pages. 
GitHub

Heavy job dispatch — .github/workflows/heavy.yml

Triggered by labels (needs-cloud) or paths; starts a cloud runner (self‑hosted or workflow calling an external job) for critical paths (bottleneck nodes). Publish artifacts: tactic/premise caches, proof traces.

Nightly “sweep” — schedule at off‑hours: run ReProver on outstanding “hard” goals with relaxed budgets; merge any deterministic wins into auto/ branches.

7) Progress monitoring
Dashboard (Streamlit or FastAPI+Svelte):

Coverage: blueprint nodes stated/can_state/proved/fully_proved (read from leanblueprint graph + \leanok). 
GitHub

Critical path: top‑k nodes by betweenness in dependency graph lacking proofs.

Search telemetry: success rates per strategy last 24h; average time/tactics; cache hit‑rates.

Host utilization: CPU/GPU usage EMA; queued goals by difficulty.

Open tickets in lemma marketplace.

Prometheus exporter in orchestrator; optional Grafana docker‑compose for local charts.

8) Cache & artifact sharing (local ↔ cloud ↔ CI)
LeanDojo cache is already designed to be portable (~/.cache/lean_dojo); respect its layout; avoid manual edits mid‑run. 
LeanDojo

Premise & tactic caches:

Store under orchestrator/cache/ with versioned header {lean_version, mathlib_rev, project_rev}.

Upload with each successful PR as a CI artifact; download for label needs-cache-sync.

Embeddings: FAISS index shards per module; bloom‑filter duplicate detection to avoid re‑indexing unchanged items.

9) Failure recovery & dedup
Ledger (sqlite): each attempt (goal_hash, strat, params, started_at, outcome, next_goals[], proof_snippet, cache_hits). On crash or cancel, the scheduler repopulates the frontier from the ledger.

Dedup: Canonicalize goal text by erasing binder names, normalizing implicit args/coercions, sorting simp sets; hash it to prevent re‑running equivalent branches.

Backtracking policy: if three strategies fail on a goal class, enqueue a marketplace ticket for a helper lemma; block deep runs until the lemma is addressed (saves cycles).

10) Concrete code & configs
Orchestrator: scheduler core (Python, asyncio)

Notes:

Uses concurrency caps and EMA throttling to stay near 50% without OS‑level CPU clamps (those are brittle on macOS).

11) Example daily workflow
You label blueprint nodes A→B→C as the critical path.

Scheduler loads frontier goals; starts micro and Copilot bursts on A; ReProver reserved for hard ones.

Proof‑Writer drafts a sketch for B; Verifier runs it through Dojo; stalls on missing equivalence; opens Lemma Request “foo.eq_iff” (priority 0.9).

Marketplace routes to a supplier; ReProver retrieves premises, proposes a 3‑tactic lemma; Verifier integrates; B completes.

Golfers reduce A’s new proof from 7 to 4 tactics.

CI passes; orchestrator makes auto/lem/foo/eq_iff PR with status/metrics; Blueprint Updater marks \leanok and deploys updated HTML.

Nightly sweep escalates a stubborn C subgoal to cloud; returns a verified script; next morning the cache suggests a similar pattern on neighboring goals.

12) Edge cases & robustness
Lean/Mathlib drift: pin toolchain + mathlib rev in lean-toolchain and lake-manifest.json. Use dependabot to update lean-action and watch CI breakage quickly. 
GitHub

Cache invalidation: augment cache keys with (lean_version, mathlib_git_sha, project_git_sha); hard‑clear on toolchain changes; soft‑clear on project import changes.

Premise bloat: when retriever repeatedly returns spurious lemmas, penalize in bandit reward; prune FAISS vectors with low usage.

Proof loops: detect via (goal_hash, tactic_seq_signature) recurrence; auto‑backoff and require new lemma.

Interruptibility: SIGINT/OS sleep → orchestrator flushes checkpoints; resume from ledger frontier.

Determinism for CI: re‑run successful sequences with random seeds fixed; store resulting script, not just logs.

13) “When to pay” decisioning (Claude vs local vs brute)
Local first for cheap patterns & medium difficulty (Copilot search_proof, micro‑enums).

If difficulty > θ and premise uncertainty high, choose ReProver (RAG).

If the goal is deep or the sketch is unclear, ask Claude to validate a plan (cheap), then authorize a longer local/cloud run only if plan looks type‑correct and aligns with available lemmas.

14) Minimal Makefile targets
init:
\tcd lean && lake update && lake exe cache get && lake build
\tenvdir orchestration python -m pip install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt

trace:
\tleandojo-trace --repo ./lean --out .cache/dojo    # wrapper around LeanDojo

bg:
\tpython -m orchestrator.main --target-util 0.5

docs:
\tleanblueprint web && lake build ProjectBigTheorem:docs

ci-local:
\tlake build && lake lint && lake test
15) What you get
Always‑on ~50% background search guided by measured difficulty and success stats.

Automatic lemma surfacing and dependency resolution via blueprint + marketplace.

Parallel branch exploration with speculative, cancellable tasks.

Smart routing between Claude reasoning, Copilot search, ReProver RAG, and brute micro‑enums.

Clean Git hygiene (auto branches/PRs, doc/blueprint updates) and observable progress (dashboard + metrics).

Caches & checkpoints that survive restarts and can be shipped between your laptop, CI, and cloud.

LeanDojo: implement stepping in orchestrator/workers/dojo.py and call from the scheduler (already wired for stubs).

ReProver: replace the stub in orchestrator/workers/reprover.py with retrieval+generation; persist premise/tactic stats to the ledger.

Lean Copilot: swap the stub in orchestrator/workers/copilot.py for search_proof/select_premises invocations; optionally uncomment the Copilot require in lean/lakefile.lean.

Heavy is a stub workflow for cloud escalations; wire it to your cluster if needed.

If you want, I can also pre‑fill the Copilot/LeanDojo/ReProver bindings in the workers with your preferred versions and knobs.

I don't know what I need / want here yet — ideas?

also this whole thing is insanely ambitious, right? do we have any evidence it will work? how far along do we need to get before we figure it out? I'm worried about having a soup of code where nothing runs and there's no clean branch to pull from

Good instincts. Don’t pick knobs yet—pick profiles you can swap in/out with one flag. Below are three pre‑filled bindings that work on your M‑series box and give you a clean go/no‑go path without code soup.

A. Pre‑filled binding profiles
Profile 0 — “Lean‑only” (lowest risk, zero ML)
Use when: bootstrapping the repo, CI sanity, or you want deterministic behavior.

Tactics: simp?, rw?, aesop with conservative options (strategy := bestFirst, maxRuleApplications := 60, maxDepth := 8).

Workers: micro only; copilot/reprover disabled.

Scheduler: MAX_LIGHT=8, MAX_HEAVY=0; keep host <50%.

Why: proves you can traverse goals, update blueprint, and produce green PRs with no external models. Aesop is designed for this exact “white‑box” search and is stable on Lean 4. 
GitHub
Lean Community

Success criteria: all stubs replaced by real Lean runs; orchestrator writes ledger entries; CI is green on every push.

Profile 1 — “Copilot‑local” (fast, self‑contained)
Use when: you want LLM help inside Lean, no Python ML stack.

Dependency: LeanCopilot pinned to your Lean (e.g., @ "v4.22.0"); add
moreLinkArgs := #["-L./.lake/packages/LeanCopilot/.lake/build/lib","-lctranslate2"]
to lakefile.lean. Then
lake update LeanCopilot && lake exe LeanCopilot/download && lake build.
Built‑in ByT5 models run locally via CTranslate2. 
GitHub

Worker binding (Python→Lean): Do not call an external API; instead use LeanDojo’s check_proof / tactic stepping to invoke Copilot tactics inside Lean. The copilot worker calls search_proof (with Aesop behind the scenes) and select_premises when needed; Verifier replays the found script through the Dojo.

Knobs (defaults that won’t cook your laptop):

search_proof: beam=4, temperature=0.2, max_steps=20, Aesop bestFirst, maxRuleApplications=80.

suggest_tactics: 8 suggestions, constrain prefixes: simp, rw, aesop.

Timeouts: 20 s per Copilot attempt; 8 s for micro; cancel on first success.

Why this works: Copilot runs inside Lean (VS Code/Lake context) with minimal friction; your M‑class CPU handles CTranslate2 well; you avoid Python GPU/transformers entirely at this stage. 
GitHub

Success criteria: on a curated “toy bank” of 100 lemmas from your project, ≥ 40% solved by micro+Copilot within the 50% CPU budget; reproducible scripts stored.

Profile 2 — “RAG‑prover” (retrieval + generator)
Use when: stuck goals need premise hunting; you accept a small Python ML stack.

Models: ReProver (ByT5) + retriever (ByT5). Use HF checkpoints:

kaiyuy/leandojo-lean4-retriever-byt5-small

kaiyuy/leandojo-lean4-retriever-tacgen-byt5-small 
GitHub

Runner: keep everything CPU‑only first; build the premise index once; set topk=12, beam=4; give 60 s budget only to goals with difficulty ≥ 0.6 (scheduler decides).

Why this works: On the LeanDojo Benchmark 4, the retrieval‑augmented prover improves Pass@1 over a non‑retrieval baseline (random split 48.6% vs 44.5; novel‑premises 19.9% vs 16.2), and LeanDojo’s interaction stack is proven to be robust on Lean 4. 
NeurIPS Papers

Success criteria: measurable lift on your in‑repo stuck goals vs Copilot‑only (e.g., +10–20% solves on the “hard” bucket), with cacheable premises.

B. What to pre‑fill in each worker
Below are the concrete default behaviors I’d wire in now (no guesswork needed later):

workers/micro.py
Implement simp_only enumerations, rw? candidates, and aesop with a cap; capture successes to a tactic template cache.

Return normalized script (simp [*] at *; aesop?) and atoms (lemmas used).

workers/copilot.py (Profile 1)
Call LeanDojo on your repo; for a named goal, execute:

select_premises (top‑12)

search_proof (beam 4, low temp)

If proof found: replay in Dojo; else: emit a lemma request (“marketplace”).

Respect wallclock budget (20 s) and cancel tokens from scheduler.
Lean Copilot’s README documents these tactics, version pinning, and local model download. 
GitHub

workers/reprover.py (Profile 2)
Maintain a FAISS (or pickled) premise index from mathlib4 + your repo deltas.

For stuck goals: retrieve top‑k premises → generate tactic → replay via Dojo.
The repo shows ready‑to‑run scripts for indexing and proving; keep them CPU‑only initially. 
GitHub

workers/dojo.py
Use LeanDojo’s gym‑like Dojo to run tactics and check proofs; consume NUM_PROCS, CACHE_DIR, TACTIC_* envs. This is your unified verifier/generator pipe. 
LeanDojo
+1

Optional: if you prefer an HTTP boundary instead of Python FFI, swap Dojo for Kimina Lean Server (LeanREPL behind a FastAPI). It’s built for parallel verification at scale; useful if you want to farm verification to a different box later. 
GitHub

C. Is this insanely ambitious? Evidence & realism
Large Lean formalizations work. The sphere eversion project formalized the full 
h
h-principle for open & ample differential relations and deduced sphere eversion; it used the interactive blueprint approach you’re adopting. 
Lean Community
+1

Ditto for large blueprints like Liquid Tensor Experiment and Tao’s PFR blueprint—blueprint‑driven dependency graphs + CI have proven their worth. 
Lean Community
What's new

ML‑assisted Lean is no longer speculative. LeanDojo provides reliable Lean 4 interaction; ReProver’s retrieval gives measurable Pass@1 gains; Lean Copilot runs models inside Lean (local or remote) with search_proof/select_premises. 
NeurIPS Papers
GitHub

Conclusion: ambitious, yes; but the components are mature enough. The key is staging and kill‑switches.

D. When will you know it’s working? (hard gates, no soup)
Adopt milestone gates that only require a few hours of setup each and give binary outcomes:

M0 — Repo boots green (Profile 0)

lake build succeeds; make bg writes ledger rows; CI is green; blueprint renders.

M1 — Copilot loop closes (Profile 1)

On a toy bank of 100 lemmas: micro+Copilot solves ≥ 40% under the 50% CPU cap; all successful proofs replay in Dojo deterministically (no interactive artifacts). 
GitHub

M2 — Retrieval helps (Profile 2)

On a hard bucket (goals that micro+Copilot fail), ReProver lifts solves by a double‑digit percentage and produces reusable premise hits; ledger shows fewer repeated failures. 
NeurIPS Papers

If you fail any gate, you stop and fix that layer before adding the next. No feature branches beyond that layer merge until green.

E. Branch & CI hygiene (so you always have a clean pull)
main is protected. Required checks: Lean build, orchestrator smoke‑test, blueprint build.

Working branch: dev. Only squash‑merge green PRs into dev.

Automation branches: auto/lem/... (bots only). They always target dev. CI auto‑labels needs-cloud to trigger heavier jobs.

Release tags: stable/M<N> whenever a milestone gate goes green; CI uploads the premise/tactic caches as an artifact so anyone can reproduce runs that week.

PR template (already in the repo) forces you to report success status, proof length change, cache hit rates, and compute budget, so junk doesn’t land silently.

F. Defaults I recommend you take (now)
Scheduler

CPU target 0.5; MAX_LIGHT=8, MAX_HEAVY=2.

Escalate to ReProver only if difficulty ≥ 0.6 and two fast strategies failed.

Copilot

search_proof: beam 4, temp 0.2, max_steps 20; Aesop bestFirst, maxRuleApplications=80.

select_premises: top‑12.

ReProver

Retrieval top‑k = 12; beam 4; 60 s budget; index refresh on module change events.

Dojo

Cache at ~/.cache/lean_dojo; NUM_PROCS = min(8, CPU/2). 
LeanDojo

G. What if nothing works? (containment)
Fail‑fast healthcheck: a job that (1) builds Lean, (2) runs bg for 30 s on 10 toy goals, (3) confirms ≥1 ledger “success”, (4) confirms blueprint emitted. Red PR banner if any step fails.

Freeze switches: features: {copilot: off, reprover: off} in config; PRs touching disabled workers are NOPs from scheduler’s POV.

Ledger‑based dedup: no worker can try the same (goal_hash, tactic_sig) twice; this caps waste.

H. If you want me to pre‑fill bindings for you
I’d ship:

workers/copilot.py that actually calls search_proof/select_premises inside Lean via Dojo;

workers/reprover.py that builds/loads an index and proposes tactics via HF;

workers/dojo.py with a tiny check_proof + run_cmd wrapper;

make sanity that runs a 100‑lemma toy bank and prints a one‑line solve rate.

You can flip between Profile 0/1/2 by setting ORCH_PROFILE=0|1|2.

If you want the pre‑fills dropped straight into the repo skeleton you downloaded, say the word and I’ll generate them with the defaults above so you can run make init && make bg and immediately see non‑stub behavior on Profile 1.

yeah included the toy lemma benchmark bank and a way to run against it would be nice

Added what you asked for: a toy lemma benchmark bank and a runner wired into the orchestrator (with profile switches). Drag-and-drop this version and you can measure solve rates immediately—even with the stub workers—then flip to Copilot/ReProver later.

Download:

Full repo w/ bank: lean4-auto-formalization-starter-with-bank.zip

What’s new
bench/bank.jsonl – 120 lemma goals labeled easy|medium|hard (Nat/List/Option arithmetic & list identities; “hard” tags are for scheduling/budgeting, not intrinsic difficulty).
orchestrator/cli/run_bank.py – a CLI that enqueues N goals with appropriate estimated_difficulty, runs the scheduler for a bounded wallclock, and writes results.
Scheduler upgrades – supports ORCH_PROFILE or ORCH_STRATEGIES to enable/disable strategies cleanly.

How to run the bank
make init
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt

# Profile 0 = micro only (deterministic baseline)
export ORCH_PROFILE=0
make bank

# Profile 1 = micro + copilot + sketch (when you wire in Lean Copilot)
export ORCH_PROFILE=1
make bank

# Profile 2 = micro + copilot + reprover + sketch (full stack)
export ORCH_PROFILE=2
make bank
What you’ll see:

A one-line summary with the number of goals that got a first-completer attempt in time.

A per-strategy table: attempt counts and how many “succeeded” (with stub workers this is simulated, but the plumbing and metrics are real).

A JSON metrics file at bench/results/bank-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json.

Dashboard still works:

make dashboard   # http://127.0.0.1:8000
How this helps you avoid “code soup”
Profiles, not knobs. You can start with Profile 0 (micro only), get green runs, then opt into Profile 1/2 without touching scheduler logic.

Ledger‑driven stop conditions. The bank runner waits until each goal has at least one attempt recorded (or times out), then stops the scheduler and writes a single JSON artifact.

Clean branch hygiene. You can gate PRs on a simple criterion: “Profile 0 bank passes locally and in CI” before you merge anything ML‑related.

Where to plug in real Lean bindings (when ready)
orchestrator/workers/copilot.py: replace the stub with a Dojo call that invokes select_premises + search_proof inside Lean, replaying the script tactic-by-tactic.

orchestrator/workers/reprover.py: build/load a ByT5-based premise index; for a given goal, retrieve → generate → replay via Dojo.

orchestrator/workers/dojo.py: thin wrapper to run tactics/check proofs using LeanDojo (unified verifier for all strategies).

Until you wire those, the bank runner still gives you an end‑to‑end harness, scheduling behavior, metrics, artifacts, and a stable baseline.

If you want, I can drop in the non‑stub Copilot/Dojo glue with a default model pin and safe timeouts, using Profile 1 as the first “real” mode.
