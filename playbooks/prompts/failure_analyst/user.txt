Given the Lean errors below, propose the smallest set of changes to make each failing lemma trivially solvable by simp/rw/apply.

Error log:
```
{{ERROR_LOG}}
```

Current file:
```lean
{{FILE_CONTENTS}}
```

For each error, provide:
1. Error diagnosis
2. Specific fix (import/attribute/aux lemma/rewrite)
3. Justification

Output structured patches:
