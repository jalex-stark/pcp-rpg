# Graph Operations for Expander Graphs

This file defines graph operations used in the PCP theorem, particularly:
1. **Graph powering** G^k: connecting vertices at distance ≤ k
2. **Spectral gap amplification**: how λ changes under powering

## Main Results (to be formalized)

- Graph powering preserves regularity with new degree d^k
- Spectral gap improves: λ(G^k) ≈ λ(G)^k for good expanders
- Explicit construction maintains polynomial-time decidability

## Graph Powering

The k-th power of a graph G connects vertices u and v if there exists a path
of length exactly k (or at most k, depending on definition) from u to v.

For d-regular expanders, G^k has the following properties:
- Degree: d^k (considering all k-step walks)
- Spectral gap: λ₂(G^k) ≈ λ₂(G)^k (eigenvalues are raised to k-th power)
- Expansion: better than G if G was already a good expander

## Basic Properties of Graph Powers
-/

/-- The 1st power of a graph is the graph itself. -/
lemma graphPower_one : G ^ 1 = G := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Prove by showing Adj relations are equivalent

/-- Powers compose: (G^j)^k = G^(j*k) -/
lemma graphPower_mul (j k : ℕ) : (G ^ j) ^ k = G ^ (j * k) := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Prove by walk concatenation

/-- For a d-regular graph, G^k is d^k-regular (considering multi-edges).
    More precisely: each vertex has exactly d^k many k-step walks. -/
lemma graphPower_regular {d : ℕ} (h : IsRegular G d) (k : ℕ) :
    ∃ (d_new : ℕ), IsRegular (G ^ k) d_new ∧ d_new ≤ d ^ k := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Count k-step walks from each vertex

## Spectral Gap Amplification

The key property: eigenvalues of G^k are k-th powers of eigenvalues of G.
For the Laplacian of a d-regular graph, if λ₂(G) = λ, then λ₂(G^k) ≈ λ^k.

This means good expanders (small λ) become better expanders when powered.
-/

/-- Adjacency matrix eigenvalues are raised to k-th power under graph powering.
    This is the spectral amplification property. -/
lemma adjMatrix_eigenvalue_power {d : ℕ} (h : IsRegular G d) (k : ℕ) :
    ∀ (i : V), True := by  -- TODO: State precisely with eigenvalue relationship
  sorry

/-- Laplacian spectral gap is amplified: if λ₂(G) = λ, then λ₂(G^k) ≈ λ^k.

    More precisely: For a d-regular graph with second eigenvalue λ,
    the k-th power has second eigenvalue approximately λ^k.

    This is Dinur's key tool: taking k = O(log n) powers gives exponentially
    small spectral gap from any constant gap. -/
lemma spectral_gap_amplification {d : ℕ} {lam : ℝ}
    (h_reg : IsRegular G d) (h_gap : hasSpectralGap G d lam) (k : ℕ) :
    hasSpectralGap (G ^ k) (d ^ k) (lam ^ k) := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Major theorem - requires adjacency/Laplacian eigenvalue analysis

/-!
## Explicit Construction Preservation

If G is explicitly constructible (polynomial-time), then so is G^k.
This is crucial for the PCP theorem: we need efficient verifiers.
-/

/-- Graph power preserves polynomial-time constructibility. -/
lemma graphPower_preserves_explicit (G : SimpleGraph V) (k : ℕ) :
    DecidableRel G.Adj → DecidableRel (G ^ k).Adj := by
  intro h_dec
  -- To decide if (u,v) ∈ G^k, enumerate all k-walks from u and check if any reaches v
  -- This is exponential in k, but k = O(log n) keeps it polynomial
  sorry  -- TODO: Implement BFS/dynamic programming decision procedure

/-- An explicit expander family remains explicit under bounded powering. -/
lemma explicitFamily_power (fam : ExplicitExpanderFamily) (k : ℕ) :
    ∃ (fam_k : ExplicitExpanderFamily),
      fam_k.d = fam.d ^ k ∧
      fam_k.lam = fam.lam ^ k ∧
      ∀ n, fam_k.graph n = (fam.graph n) ^ k := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Construct powered family and verify properties
