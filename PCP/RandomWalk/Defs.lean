# Random Walks on Graphs

Definitions for random walks on regular graphs, used in the expander mixing lemma
and the analysis of constraint graph preprocessing in Dinur's proof.

## Main Definitions

- `transitionMatrix`: Stochastic matrix for one-step random walk
- `randomWalk`: t-step random walk distribution
- `uniformDistribution`: Uniform distribution on vertices

## References

- Dinur, §2 (pp. 7-9): Spectral analysis and random walk properties

/-- The transition matrix for a random walk on a d-regular graph.
    Entry (u,v) is 1/d if there's an edge from u to v, 0 otherwise. -/
def transitionMatrix (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj] (d : ℕ)
    (h : d > 0) : Matrix V V ℚ :=
  fun u v => if G.Adj u v then (1 : ℚ) / d else 0

/-- The transition matrix is stochastic: rows sum to 1 for regular graphs.

    Proof strategy: Sum of row u equals (1/d) * degree(u) = (1/d) * d = 1.
    The degree equals the number of neighbors by degree_eq_card_neighborSet.
    For a d-regular graph, every vertex has exactly d neighbors. -/

/-- Distribution over vertices (represented as a probability function).

    Note: We use `V → ℚ` instead of mathlib's `PMF` (Probability Mass Function) because:
    1. We only need finite, discrete distributions over finite vertex sets
    2. We need exact rational arithmetic for decidability (not ℝ≥0∞)
    3. The PCP theorem is fundamentally combinatorial, not measure-theoretic
    4. This avoids heavy measure theory machinery and keeps proofs combinatorial

    Future work could define conversions to/from `PMF` for interoperability. -/

/-- The mixing time: number of steps until the walk is close to uniform.

    Note: This is axiomatized as computing it requires spectral analysis.
    In practice, it depends on the spectral gap. -/

/-- For expander graphs, the mixing time is logarithmic in the number of vertices.

    Note: The precise bound depends on the spectral gap and uses a logarithmic function.
    We axiomatize this for now as it requires spectral analysis. -/

## Application to Constraint Graphs

Random walks on constraint graphs relate violation patterns to UNSAT amplification.

/-- If a random walk starting from a violating vertex hits many violating vertices,
    then walk-based constraints will be violated frequently. -/

  -- lands in violated_set with probability proportional to |violated_set|/|V|

    violated_set.sum (randomWalk G d h t u) ≥
      (violated_set.card : ℚ) / Fintype.card V - (1 : ℚ) / 10 := by
