# Assignment Tester Interface

Assignment tester structure with soundness and completeness properties.

Assignment testers are the key to alphabet reduction in Dinur's proof.
They test whether a long assignment is consistent with a short one.

## Composition Reduces Alphabet

Composing CSP with assignment tester preserves UNSAT while reducing alphabet.

### Key Insight

Replace each long assignment (from large alphabet α) with:
1. A short assignment (from small alphabet Σ₀)
2. A local tester that verifies consistency

### Construction (High-Level)

Given CSP G over alphabet α and tester P:
- **New variables**: Same as G (one per vertex)
- **New alphabet**: Σ₀ (constant size, independent of |α|)
- **New constraints**: For each edge (u,v) in G:
  1. **Local tests**: Check that short assignments at u,v are "good"
  2. **Consistency check**: Verify the short assignments encode consistent long assignments
  3. **Original constraint**: If decoded, check G's original constraint

### Soundness Intuition

- If composed CSP has low UNSAT → short assignments are mostly good
- Good short assignments decode to long assignments
- Decoded long assignments satisfy most constraints in original G
- Therefore original G has low UNSAT

### Alphabet Reduction

- Original alphabet α can be exponentially large (grows during powering)
- Reduced alphabet Σ₀ is constant (typically |Σ₀| ≈ 10-16)
- This is crucial: prevents alphabet explosion during iteration
