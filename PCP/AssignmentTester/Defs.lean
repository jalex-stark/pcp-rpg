# Assignment Tester Interface

Assignment tester structure with soundness and completeness properties.

Assignment testers are the key to alphabet reduction in Dinur's proof.
They test whether a long assignment is consistent with a short one.

## Composition Reduces Alphabet

Composing CSP with assignment tester preserves UNSAT while reducing alphabet.

/-- Composition preserves UNSAT up to a constant factor. -/
theorem composition_soundness {V α : Type*} [Fintype V] [Fintype α] [DecidableEq V]
    (G : BinaryCSP V α) :
  ∃ (β : ℚ),
    0 < β ∧
    let G' := P.compose G
    -- Soundness: UNSAT is preserved
    G'.unsat ≥ β * G.unsat := by
  sorry

/-- Composition increases size by at most a constant factor. -/

    (G : BinaryCSP V α) :
  ∃ (C : ℕ),
    let G' := P.compose G
    G'.size ≤ C * G.size := by
  sorry

/-- The composed graph uses the reduced alphabet. -/
theorem composition_alphabet_reduction {V α : Type*} [Fintype V] [Fintype α] [DecidableEq V]
    (G : BinaryCSP V α) :
  let G' := P.compose G
  -- Alphabet is reduced to Σ₀
  True := by  -- Type is BinaryCSP (Σ (v : V), Unit) Σ₀
