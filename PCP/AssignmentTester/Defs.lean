# Assignment Tester Interface

Assignment tester structure with soundness and completeness properties.

Assignment testers are the key to alphabet reduction in Dinur's proof.
They test whether a long assignment is consistent with a short one.

## Composition Reduces Alphabet

Composing CSP with assignment tester preserves UNSAT while reducing alphabet.

The key insight: Replace each long assignment (from large alphabet α) with
a short assignment (from small alphabet Σ₀) plus a local tester that verifies
consistency.
